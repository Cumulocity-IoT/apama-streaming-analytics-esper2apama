# Disclaimer on use
This tool is not intended to fully translate all possible Esper language
features to Apama EPL. It's intended to translate the most common Esper language
features, either fully or partially, in order to save time in a manual
translation project. The translation is as reliable as is possible, given the
different semantics of Esper and Apama.

For this reason, no guarantees of absolute correctness can be made. Any Apama
EPL output by this tool should always be reviewed by a human, amended if
necessary, and subjected to acceptance testing.

Special attention should be paid to auto-generated notices in the EPL.
* TODO:E2A - Esper code that the tool did not know how to translate.
* WARN:E2A - EPL that was successfully translated, but not with 100% fidelity.

# Known limitations
The following language features are not currently supported by the tool.

@UNSUPPORTED_FEATURES@

There are many built-in types and functions supported in Esper that are not
supported, but these are too many to enumerate.

# Building the E2A tool yourself
The Esper 2 Apama tool is built using Java 8, [xpybuild](https://github.com/xpybuild/xpybuild) and the [ANTLR 4 Java binaries](https://www.antlr.org/download.html).

To build, you will need to pass the ANTLR 4 location to xpybuild. For example:
```
xpybuild.py ANTLR4_JAR=../antlr-4.8-complete.jar
```
